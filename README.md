# About the Project: Drag and Drop Using object-oriented programming with Javascript typescript (Version 1: Basic)


The Drag and Drop application is a user-friendly project management tool built with object-oriented programming principles using JavaScript and TypeScript. It empowers users to seamlessly organize their projects by allowing them to add, switch the status between active and finished, and even delete projects effortlessly.

By leveraging validators, the application ensures that the projects added by users adhere to specific criteria, such as valid project names and required fields. This validation mechanism guarantees data integrity and prevents inconsistencies within the application.

Decorators play a pivotal role in enhancing the drag and drop functionality, enabling smooth interactions between projects. They add additional behaviors and visual cues to the draggable and droppable elements, making the project management experience more intuitive and engaging.

The utilization of classes provides a structured approach to managing project-related operations, encapsulating functionalities such as adding, switching status, and deleting projects. This promotes code organization, reusability, and maintainability, making it easier to extend and enhance the application's capabilities.

The application takes full advantage of TypeScript's powerful type system, utilizing various types like generics, interfaces, and custom types. This ensures that the application remains robust and reliable, as it enforces type safety and prevents potential runtime errors. Additionally, it enhances the developer experience by providing comprehensive type checking and auto-completion features.

In summary, the Drag and Drop application exemplifies the benefits of object-oriented programming, TypeScript's type system, and the integration of validators, decorators, and various types. This combination results in a user-friendly project management solution that promotes efficient organization, seamless interaction, and a delightful user experience.
